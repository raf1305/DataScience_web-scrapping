This is a project on web scrapping.In this project we search online news portal bbc.com/news for a article about a specific word on its title and collect a number of news article title,date and link in a csv file and article text in a text file.

We can define the parameters in configuration.py file about the specific word in variable named "search" and number of article we want to scrap in variable "article_number".

The results are on search of "coronavirus" and 20 article about it on bbc.com.
